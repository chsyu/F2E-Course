Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family.

Initially designed by [Matt McInerney](http://blog.matt.cc/) as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. In 2013 the Italics where added, and most recently â€” a variable version.

It features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.
